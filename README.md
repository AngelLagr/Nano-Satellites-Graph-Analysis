# NanoSatellites_GraphAnalysis
This project involves the analysis of graphs modeling a swarm of nanosatellites orbiting the Moon. The nanosatellites exchange data via opportunistic routing, with scalable communication ranges (20 km, 40 km, 60 km). The project aims to model the swarm in graph form and analyze its characteristics in different configurations.
